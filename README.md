## üìä Tableau Business Analytics Project

This project explores business performance trends using **Tableau dashboards** built on sales data from **2019 to 2022**. The goal was to uncover actionable insights and recommend strategies to enhance future profitability.

### üîç Key Highlights
- **Sales & Customer Segments**: Identified that consumer segments drove the most revenue, with APAC and EU as top-performing markets.
- **Shipping Cost Analysis**: Found APAC incurred the highest shipping costs, and standard shipping was most preferred across order priorities.
- **Profitability & Discounts**: Tables were the only product sub-category incurring losses, largely due to high average discounts of **29%**.
- **Forecasting Performance**: Projected sales and profit trends for the next two years, with **technology products** showing high volatility.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Proposed a three-pronged strategy:
  - Implement a **targeted discount policy** for unprofitable items (e.g. tables)
  - **Capitalise on seasonal peaks** like Q3 and Q4
  - Launch **loyalty programmes** and clearance sales to boost underperforming quarters
